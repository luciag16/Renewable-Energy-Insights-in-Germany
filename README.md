# Renewable-Energy-Insights-in-Germany

This repository contains a Power BI project that provides insights into renewable energy usage in Germany. The project includes data analysis and visualizations on the share of renewable energy, avoided greenhouse gas emissions, and the contribution of renewable fuels.

## Files

- `renewable_energies.pbix`: The Power BI project file.
- `renewable_energies.pdf`: A PDF export of the Power BI report.
- `avoided_greenhouse.ipynb`, `balances.ipynb`, `contribution_cons.ipynb`, `share_energy_germany_new.ipynb`: Python scripts used for data cleaning and preprocessing (Jupyter Notebbok).

## Viewing the Project

1. **Power BI File (.pbix)**:
   - Download the `renewable_energies.pbix` file.
   - Open it in [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).

2. **PDF Report**:
   - Open the `renewable_energies.pdf` file to view the report in PDF format.

3. **Python Scripts**:
   - Jupyter Notebooks files that contain the codes used for data cleaning and preprocessing. These scripts demonstrate the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis in Power BI.

## About the Project

This Power BI project was developed to analyze and visualize renewable energy data in Germany. It includes:

- **Line Chart**: Trend of the share of energy from renewable sources over time.
- **Pie Chart**: Contribution of various renewable fuels to gross final consumption.
- **Stacked Bar Chart**: Avoided greenhouse gas emissions by sector.
- **Data Table**: IRENA Renewable Energy Data Balances.
