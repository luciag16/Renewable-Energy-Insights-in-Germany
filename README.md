## About the Project

This Power BI project was developed to analyze and visualize renewable energy data in Germany. It includes:

- **Line Chart**: Trend of the share of energy from renewable sources over time.
- **Pie Chart**: Contribution of various renewable fuels to gross final consumption.
- **Stacked Bar Chart**: Avoided greenhouse gas emissions by sector.
- **Data Table**: IRENA Renewable Energy Data Balances.
